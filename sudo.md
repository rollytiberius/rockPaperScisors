# Rock paper scissors game

## Write the logic to get the computer choice

Your game will be played against the computer. You will write a function that randomly returns “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.

Create a new function named getComputerChoice.
Write the code so that getComputerChoice will randomly return one of the following string values: “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.
Hint:
The Math.random method returns a random number that’s greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. Think about how you can use this to conditionally return one of the multiple choices.
Note:
Some learners might think that arrays are necessary for this problem, but they aren’t. If you’re unfamiliar with arrays, don’t worry - they’ll be covered later in the curriculum.

### My pseudo code

Before to use the getComputerChoice function we need an array to chose from

declare an array named choiceArray [[rock, paper, scissors]]

The getComputerChoice function will return the computer choice
